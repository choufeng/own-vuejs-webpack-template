# own-vue-webpack-template

> 基于官方模版完善自用的模版

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Version Notice

If you are using `vue-cli@1.x`, it will be pulling the `master` branch of this template by default. If you are using `vue-cli@2.x`, it will be pulling the `dist` branch instead, which provides more configurable options thanks to new features in `vue-cli@2.x`. It is recommended to upgrade `vue-cli` as soon as you can.
